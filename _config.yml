user_description: My name is Gabriela Reyes and I am a graduate student at New Mexico State University. Experienced researcher in cell, molecular, and developmental biology. I am interested in the intriguing mechanics of cytokinesis in sea urchin embryos. My research has led me to learn a lot at the cellular level. My work consists of imaging using various types of microscopy to view nanoscale structures in a fascinating structure called the contractile ring. Most of my time is spent in a laboratory setting but I am also learning computer programming and have some experience in Python and R programming, I obtained a Google Data Analytics certification. In the future Iâ€™d love to apply my experiences in the field of cancer research.
